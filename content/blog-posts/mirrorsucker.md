Mirrorsucker, they call her, the small girl with dark hair, and they say that she sucks on mirrors because no one wants to suck on her. She and I are not friends, really—she barely speaks to anyone—but I really hate those kids, the ones who call her mirrorsucker. I don't put it past them to have made up the story about sucking mirrors, but I don't know any better—they say it happens in the girls' bathroom.

It was hot today, far too hot in our airless classrooms. Mum and Dad are asleep, but I find myself at the front door, still too much heat in me, drawn by the smell of the cooling evening. I walk, to the shops, not far. It's a small town, it’s late—I don't see anyone. But, in front of the shoe shop, I see the girl. I don't think that she sees me. Her face, her lips, are pressed to the black shopfront, to her reflection. But it looks to me more like the mirrored glass is doing the sucking, like the other thing clearly visible in the glass, dark and clutching, needs the girl, just as much as she needs it.
