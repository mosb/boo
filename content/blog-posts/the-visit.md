Our friends live on the other side of town. They, too, have young kids. We have never visited them before. Mid-winter dusk, and all the other houses on the street are dark.

Max opens the door for us, and apologises for the mess. It's an English terrace, cramped by low ceilings, bookshelves of toys and clothes. Our kids are hesitant, we whisper down at their level. Then Max's kids run out; all kids run upstairs.

Preparing some food, Max and I speak. Their 7YO Felix is refusing school, waiting two years for an assessment from child and mental health services, so they haven't left the house for a while, really, but they've had lots of time together as a family, all learned a lot, not like Max to talk like this, developed Felix's interests, helped to calm him down, still some crying in the night, sometimes the crying doesn't even sound like him, like it was a man, but engaging the interests does help, even in the night, calms him down, school has been useless, then screaming from upstairs, shredding my mind, our 2YO, Max doesn't stop, but I must go up.

2YO is on the floor of Felix's bedroom, face down on the carpet, screaming. In the bedroom, on the walls, bed, lowered blackout blinds, all surfaces, are eyes, all types, mostly drawn in chalk. 

Who drew all these? I ask.

Two of them, Felix says.

I wonder about all the dark houses on the street, wonder if there are eyes in them, too.
