Our friends live on the other side of town. They also have two kids. We have never visited them before. Mid-winter dusk, and all the other houses on the street are dark.

Max opens the door for us, and apologises for the mess. It's an English terrace, cramped by low ceilings, bookshelves of toys and clothes. Our kids are hesitant, we whisper down at their level. Then Max's kids run out, all four run upstairs.

Preparing some food, Max and I speak. Their 7YO is refusing school, waiting two years for an assessment from child and mental health services, so they haven't left the house for a while, really, but they've had lots of time together as a family, all learned a lot, uncharacteristic of Max to talk like this, developed 7YO's interests, helped to calm him down, less crying in the night, sometimes the crying didn't even sound like him, like it was a man, but engaging the interests does help, even in the night, calms him down, then crying from upstairs, shredding my mind, our 2YO, Max doesn't stop, but I must go up.

Eyes in chalk all over the bedroom.

Who drew all these? I ask.

Two of them, he says.

I wonder about all the dark houses on the street, wonder if there are eyes in them, too.
