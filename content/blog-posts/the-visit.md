Our friends live on the other side of town. They also have two kids. We have never visited them before. 

Max opens the door for us, and apologises for the mess. The house is an English terrace, cramped by low ceilings and bookshelves of toys and dirty clothes. Our kids need encouragement to go in, but then happily run upstairs to play with Max's kids.

Max and I speak, preparing some food. Their 7YO is refusing school, waiting two years for an assessment from child and mental health services, so they haven't left the house for a while, really, but they've had lots of time together as a family, all learned a lot, 

but it's OK

he just gets so obsessed. Obsessed with what? Eyes.

Eyes in chalk all over the bedroom.

It's not that big a problem, he smiles. 

The children play 

All neighbours abandoned houses 

I wonder if there are eyes in there too.
