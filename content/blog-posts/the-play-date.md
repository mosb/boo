Our friends live on the other side of town. They, too, have young kids. We have never visited them before. Mid-winter dusk, and all the other houses on the street are dark.

Max opens the door for us, and apologises for the mess. It is an English terrace, cramped by low ceilings, bookshelves of toys, clothes, feathers, statues. Our kids are hesitant, we whisper down at their level. Then Max's kids run out; all kids run upstairs.

Setting the table with snacks, Max and I speak. Their 7YO Felix is refusing school, waiting two years for an assessment from child and mental health services, so they haven't left the house for a while, really, but they've had lots of time together as a family, all learned a lot, not like Max to talk like this, developed Felix's interests, helped to calm him down, still crying in the night, sometimes the crying doesn't even sound like him, like it was a man, but engaging with his interests does help, even in the night, calms him down, the school has been useless, then screaming from upstairs, shredding my mind, our 2YO, Max doesn't stop, but I must go up.

2YO is on the floor of Felix's bedroom, face down on the carpet, screaming, still screaming when in my arms, 5YO screams to come up, too, I clutch both. In the cluttered bedroom, on the walls, bed, lowered blackout blinds, all surfaces, mostly drawn in chalk, are eyes, all types.

Who drew all these? I ask.

It changes, Felix says.

He turns around, and, on the back of his neck, another eye, still bloody, dripping. I wonder about all the dark houses on the street, wonder if there are eyes on them, too.
