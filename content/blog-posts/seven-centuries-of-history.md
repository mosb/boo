When William finally died, heirless, the college mourned for its longest-serving fellow. Out of respect, for a decade, no-one sat on his chair in the senior common room. Then we dug him up, and put him back on it. He was very thin, but still looked distinguished in his suit and gown. For domus evenings, we arranged for one of the kitchen staff to squeeze her teats into his grinning maw. We knew that he would have liked that, and we also thought that her milk might fatten him up a bit. If nothing else, the spoiled milk did begin to make him smell a bit better. We also began to treat William to others of his indulgences, and, as a result, during second desserts, he began to do his part by passing the port bottle to his right, new strings of grey flesh twitching, nascent eyeballs flaccid but swivelling. We always thanked him profusely for his aidâ€”we never liked him much, but we did not dare risking him not liking us, especially now he was getting bigger.
