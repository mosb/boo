They say that the witch lives in the outdoor pool. I know betterâ€”she lives in its shadows, powers waxing with the season. Today, all concrete edges glint in the sharp summer sun, water shining.

Too late, I see my younger brother swim through the diving board's shadow. He climbs out, beaded, still gripped by shadow. The summer passes. But he is changed.

My brother never spoke much. Now he doesn't speak at all. A phase, mum and dad say.

Mid-winter, I return to the pool, through a gap in the fence. The shadows are dim, blurred; the cold pool empty. Except for my brother. He is in the water, naked. I walk out on the diving board, shivering. He does not look at me.

I wait for the weak sun to peak. Then he speaks. After we get home, he starts speaking again, and everyone says that they are glad that the phase seems to be over. But no-one says anything about my brother now speaking with the voice of the witch.
